# DIY-Powermeter
This project is a monitoring system designed to measure voltage, current, power, and energy consumption using an Arduino Nano, Adafruit INA219 current sensor, and multiple OLED displays. The system also includes a buzzer to provide an alert when the voltage exceeds a certain threshold.
